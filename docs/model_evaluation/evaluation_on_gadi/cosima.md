# COSIMA Cookbook on Gadi


<a href="http://cosima.org.au/" target="_blank">COSIMA</a> stands for the Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia, which brings together Australian-based researchers involved in global ocean and sea ice modelling. The <i>COSIMA Cookbook</i> is a collection of "recipes", i.e., computational notebooks in the form of tutorials and documented examples that are curated for analysing output from ocean-sea ice models.

???+ warning "Support Level: Supported on <i>Gadi</i>, but not owned by ACCESS-NRI"
    <!-- Who develped the tool? -->
    The <i>COSIMA Cookbook</i> is developed and maintained by COSIMA. While ACCESS-NRI does not own the code, it actively supports the use of the recipes within the <i>COSIMA Cookbook</i> on <i>Gadi</i>. 
    ACCESS-NRI provides access to the latest version of <i>COSIMA Cookbook</i> via the `hh5` `access-med` conda environment for Model Evaluation on Gadi.

The <i>COSIMA Cookbook</i> framework focuses on the <a href="/models/configurations/access-om">ACCESS-OM2</a> suite of models being developed and run by members of <a href="http://cosima.org.au/" target="_blank">COSIMA</a>. Nevertheless, this framework is suited to analysing any MOM5/MOM6 output as well as output from other models.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to use the _COSIMA Cookbook_ is through the [Australian Research Environment (ARE)](https://are.nci.org.au)" on _Gadi_.<br>
To be able to access _Gadi_ you need to have an NCI account. For more information, check how to [Set Up your NCI Account](/getting_started/set_up_nci_account).

To use the <i>COSIMA Cookbook</i> that is pre-installed in the `conda/analysis3` environment of *hh5*, you need to <a href="https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/hh5" target="_blank">join NCI project *hh5*</a>.

1. Login  via *ssh* to <i>Gadi</i> and clone the <a href="https://github.com/COSIMA/cosima-recipes" target="_blank"><i>cosima-recipes</i></a> repository to your local directory.  

2. Find the recipes that you want to run and make sure you have access to the specific projects and their storage (e.g., project *ik11* to get access to */g/data/ik11*).

3. Start an <a href="https://are.nci.org.au" target="_blank">ARE JupyterLab</a> session on NCI:  
  <b>Storage</b>: `gdata/hh5` (add the specific storage you need for the recipe you want to run)
  <br>
  <b>Module directories</b>: `/g/data/hh5/public/modules`  
  <b>Modules</b>: `conda/analysis3`
  <br>
  If you are new to ARE, refer to instructions on [Getting Started with ARE](/getting_started/are).
1. Within the ARE environment, navigate to one of the COSIMA recipes and run the analysis.
