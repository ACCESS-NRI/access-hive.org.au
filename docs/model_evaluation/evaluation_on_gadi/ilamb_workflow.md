# ILAMB-workflow on Gadi

## What is ILAMB?

The <a href="https://www.ilamb.org/" target="_blank">International Land Model Benchmarking (<i>ILAMB</i>)</a> benchmarking system is a python framework used to quantitatively compare a defined set of observable variables with a number of land models.
    
This documentation is tailored to using <i>ILAMB</i> on <i>Gadi</i> and, hence, it supplements rather than replaces the official documentation. Users are encouraged to read the <a href="https://www.ilamb.org/doc/" target="_blank">ILAMB documentation</a> and relevant <a href="https://www.ilamb.org/doc/tutorial.html" target="_blank">tutorials</a>.

!!! note
    ACCESS-NRI is supporting an NCI configuration of ILAMB under the name _ILAMB-workflow_.

*ILAMB-workflow* is the ACCESS-NRI software and data infrastructure that enables the ILAMB evaluation framework on NCI Gadi. It includes the 

- *ILAMB* Python packages, 
- a series of *ILAMB* outputs for ACCESS model evaluation,
- the *ILAMB-Data* collection of observational datasets. 

ILAMB-workflow is configured to use the existing NCI supported CMIP data collections.

## Using ILAMB on Gadi

### Pre-requisites

To use *ILAMB* on *Gadi* ensure you fulfill the [Set Up your NCI Account](/getting_started/set_up_nci_account) section.
<i>ILAMB</i> is provided through the <a href="https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/xp65/join" target="_blank">xp65</a> NCI projects on <i>Gadi</i>, so you need to have an NCI account and be a member of this projects to use it. 

<div class='admonition warning'>
    To obtain an NCI account and join NCI projects, refer to <a href="/getting_started/set_up_nci_account" target="_blank">Set Up your NCI Account</a>.
</div>

Depending on your needs, you may want to also join the following supported data collections:

- CMIP6: [fs38](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/fs38/join), [oi10](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/oi10/join)
- CMIP5: [rr3](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/rr3/join), [al33](https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/al33/join)

### Loading the ILAMB-workflow modules
 <!-- #### Load the `access-med` conda environment -->

To load the the *ilamb* module, execute the following commands:
```
    module use /g/data/xp65/public/modules
    module load conda/access-med
```

Visit <a href="https://ilamb-workflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest" target="_blank">ACCESS-NRI documentation</a> on how to run <i>ILAMB</i> on <i>Gadi</i>.

<br>
To run <i>ILAMB</i>, you need to execute the command `ilamb-run` with a number of arguments/ files:
```
ilamb-run --config config.cfg --model_setup model_setup.txt --regions regions.txt
```
<ul>
    <li>
    <i>config.cfg</i> defines which observables and observational datasets to be compared.
    <li>
    <i>model_setup.txt</i> defines the paths of models that to be compared.
    <li>
    <i>regions.txt</i> defines the regions to be compared, e.g., <i>global</i>, <i>aust</i> (Australia), etc.
</ul>

While these files can be self-defined, ACCESS-NRI provides the necessary files and tools to set your model paths to run on <i>Gadi</i>. All you need to do is decide which observations and models you wish to compare. 
<br>
NCI hosts replicas of the <i>ILAMB</i> observational data sets through the NCI project <a href="https://my.nci.org.au/mancini/project/ct11/join" target="_blank">ct11</a> as well as a large amount of model outputs are available on <i>Gadi</i>, such as ACCESS model output.

For more information, refer to <a href="\model_evaluation/data/observations" target="_blank">Observational Data Catalogue</a> on how to find observational data on NCI and <a href="/model_evaluation/data/model_catalogs" target="_blank">ACCESS-NRI Intake Catalog</a> for how to find model outputs.
<br>
To learn more about how to adjust the <i>ILAMB</i> setup, refer to the official <a href="https://www.ilamb.org/doc/" target="_blank">ILAMB documentation</a> and relevant <a href="https://www.ilamb.org/doc/tutorial.html" target="_blank">tutorials</a>.

## Example: CMIP6 comparisons and ACCESS ESM1.5 benchmarking

ACCESS-NRI is maintaining a collection of benchmark comparisons for the ACCESS community, such as that with Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) data, see in the <a href="https://ilamb-workflow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/ILAMB.html#ilamb-cmip-confrontations-maintained-by-access-nri" target="_blank">workflow documentation.</a>


In the following example, the supported ACCESS Earth System Model (ESM) <a href="/models/access-esm#access-esm1.5" target="_blank">ACCESS-ESM1.5</a> is compared with two other ESM models:

- <a href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/13/977/2020/" target="_blank">BCC ESM1 (Beijing Climate Center Earth System Model version 1)</a>
- <a href="https://gmd.copernicus.org/articles/12/4823/2019/gmd-12-4823-2019.html" target="_blank">CanESM5 (Canadian Earth System Model version 5)</a>

Numerous benchmark comparisons have been defined in the configuration file. The comparison of variables have been organised under different sections, such as the <i>Hydrology Cycle</i>. 
<br>
For other variables, such as the <i>git Gross Primary Productivity</i> (*gpp*), one or more datasets are available. For example, the gross primary productivity measurements of <a href="https://fluxnet.org/data/fluxnet2015-dataset/" target="_blank">FLUXNET2015</a>. 
<br>
<br>
By clicking on a row in the table, you can expand it to see the underlying datasets used. The table's colourmap extends from best values in purple to worse data in orange.

Clicking on one of these datasets, for example `CERESed4.1`, will take you to an interactive and quantitative comparison page for Albedo measurements of the <a href="https://ceres.larc.nasa.gov" target="_blank">Clouds and the Earth’s Radiant Energy System (CERES)</a> project:
