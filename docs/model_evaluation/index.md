#  Data and Model Evaluation 


In this section you will find some collated information on data in the context of climate modelling which is important for model evaluation. Then there is also a collation of model evaluation tools available on *Gadi*. If you are new to using the Gadi supercomputer, visit the [Set Up your NCI Account](/getting_started/set_up_nci_account) section for instructions on how to get an account, log in, and get set up to access climate data on Gadi. ACCESS-NRI supports and maintains the [conda/analysis3 _Python_ environment](/getting_started/environments) which contains most of the evaluation and data tools described.
<!--## Prerequisites

If you are new to MED and are wondering [*"What is Model Evaluation and Diagnostics about?"*](./model_evaluation_getting_started/index.md), we recommend you read our [Getting Started with MED page](./model_evaluation_getting_started/index.md): -->

### Tools in development

For the evaluation and diagnosis of ACCESS climate models, the following tools are currently being setup:  

* Data format processing tools like APP4  
* An Evaluation Recipe Gallery with searching functionality  

While this work is in progress, you can refer to a collection of links to existing tools (not curated by ACCESS-NRI) in the [community tab](../community_resources/index.md). -->


<!-- THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE

## TBD: CMORisation

TBD: Raw data vs. curated data: CMORized vs. not! What does CMORized actually mean (look at ESMValTool documentation)?
TBD: Add APP4 to navigation (replace **Model Format Processing**?)
TBD: Tools to check if data is CMOR-compliant (raise issue)
TBD: Discuss with Dougie: How can we identify what is CMORized and what is not?
