# Training and Policies

{% include "call_contribute.md" %}

This space is intended to promote training material relevant to ACCESS and its community. The training material can be directly relevant to ACCESS and its model components, such as:

- using coupled models and model components
- using configurations
- using model evaluation tools and workflows

It is also intended for training material around more peripheral topics that are essential for the community, such as:

- HPC
- version control
- essential software packages

ACCESS-NRI encourages the members of the community to [contact us](mailto:access.nri@anu.edu.au) to share their suggestions.


Finally, you will also find [ACCESS-NRI's policies][policies] in this space.
